## FAQ
### Why not a static site?
This list of mods in terrifyingly long. It would require manually writing thousands of lines of HTML. To speed stuff up, I prefer to use Pug as it requires less work to build a site. It also comes with the benefit of being able to handle variables. This is a heavily modified version of [static-pug](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/static-pug).

### Why change the logo?
The logo needed to be updated for GEMSSE, and designing a new one was easier than photoshopping the old one.

### Can I use this repo to make my own mod list?
Sure. Feel free to use this as a starting point. It's also open-source so should I stop maintaining it, others can fork it.

### This code is terrible
Yes, I am aware. There is a lot of optimization I could do to improve it, but this generates static sites. Speed and efficiency aren't very important here.
