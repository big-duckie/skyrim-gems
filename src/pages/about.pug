      p Skyrim GEMS is a comprehensive, quick-reference catalog of over 1000 lore-friendly gameplay enhancement mods that improve how the game plays with a focus on mods that create a more realistic, immersive, and challenging experience.
      p This project was originally started by Ka3m0n, but has since fallen into disrepair with many broken links. I've decided to resurrect the page, give it a bit of a makeover, and ensure all links are still working. This project is hosted through GitHub Pages, and is open-source. Feel free to give suggestions for new mods, or changes to the existing list.
      p I've also taken the time to build a complementary list for Skyrim Special Edition. Not all of the mods are there, as some weren't ported, and there are many mods I haven't seen so feel free to send some suggestions on the #[a(href="https://github.com/big-duckie/skyrim-gems") GEMS GitHub].
